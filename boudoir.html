                            The pictures turned out beautifully.

                            "When I booked my shoot with Jensine, at the time I was going through some real body image issues.
                            I was in a relationship where I didn’t feel sexy, and I got into the cycle of comparing myself to women I saw online.
                            So, I needed something to boost how I viewed myself.
                            When I saw the photos she took, I was shocked because these were real images that challenged the negative self talk I had been using against myself.
                            Jensine made it more than a photoshoot, she was very kind, authentic, uplifting, and honest. 
                            Definitely a worthy investment, plus you get wine." -Abby

                            and she made me feel so confident and feel better about my self-image.
                            The pictures were absolutely fantastic, and she is one of the sweetest,
