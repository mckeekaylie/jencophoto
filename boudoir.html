                        I was in a relationship where I didn’t feel sexy, and I got into the cycle of comparing myself to women I saw online. 
                        So, I needed something to boost how I viewed myself. 
                        When I saw the photos she took, I was shocked because these were real images that challenged the negative self talk I had been using against myself.
                        Jensine made it more than a photoshoot, she was very kind, authentic, uplifting, and honest. 
                        Definitely a worthy investment, plus you get wine." -Abby

                        The pictures were absolutely fantastic, and she is one of the sweetest, caring, and talented people I have ever met.
